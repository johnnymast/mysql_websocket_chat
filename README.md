# MYSQL WEBSOCKET CHAT

Welcome to this Hackaton project I created for user hrushi on [phpclasses.org](http://www.phpclasses.org/recommend/754-I-need-to-create-realtime-user-to-user-chat.html). The idea was to create a web socket chat application
that could be logging to a database. So here is what you need to get this up and running. ***Please note*** the minimum required PHP version is 7.4 this is because the dependencies this project has.


## Step 1: install composer

First thing you have to do is installing composer on to your system. You can get composer [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/). Don't worry it might seem intimidating, but it is really not.

## Step 2: Install the project 

### Using composer

Installing the project using composer is hands down the easiest way to get started. This method will download the project from GitHub
and automatically install its dependencies for you. Presuming you installed composer (step 1) execute the following commands on the command-line.

```bash
$ composer create-project johnnymast/mysql_websocket_chat chat
$ cd chat
```

<em>In the above example I am using a mac so my prompt will display different then you if you are on windows.</em>

### Downloaded from phpclasses.org

If you download this package in a zip file from [phpclasses.org](http://www.phpclasses.org/package/9947-PHP-Websocket-starter-project.html) you will have to extract the zip package to a location of your liking. Then 
change directory into that directory and execute the following command on your prompt.

```bash
$ composer install
```

<em>In the above example I am using a mac so my prompt will display different then you if you are on windows.</em>


## Step 3: Configure the server

### Websocket configuration

This project can be split into two different components. The WebSocket server is the <code>server.php</code> in the root directory. The second part
is the frontend part located in <code>public/index.php</code>. For the WebSocket server, there are two configuration options that you can configure in <code>includes/config.php</code>.

##### WEBSOCKET_SERVER_IP

This flag allows you to configure the WebSocket server's IP-address. By default the value <code>127.0.0.1</code> has been set.

##### WEBSOCKET_SERVER_PORT  

This will configure what port the WebSocket server will listen on. The default value has been set to <code>8090</code>. You can change this
value if it clashes with other services running on your machine.



### Database configuration

This server can run either with or without a database. By default i have disabled the use of a database server (<code>ENABLE_DATABASE</code>) but you can enable it by switching the <code>ENABLE_DATABASE</code> to <code>true</code>
in the [includes/config.php](https://github.com/johnnymast/mysql_websocket_chat/blob/master/includes/config.php) file. 

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DATABASE_HOST | The database hostname/ip goes in here. By default this has been set to <code>root</code>. |
| DATABASE_PORT | The database port. By default this has been set to <code>3306</code>. |
| DATABASE_USERNAME | The database username goes in here. By default this has been set to <code>root</code>.|
| DATABASE_PASSWORD | Enter the password to access the database there. By default this has been set to <code>root</code>.|
| DATABASE_DB | Enter the name of the database here. By default this has been set to <code>socket_chat</code>.|
| ENABLE_DATABASE | This flag will turn using the database on or off by setting its value to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.|


***Please note*** if you enable the database make sure you update the credentials as well (see table above). Also if you enable the database make sure you have imported [database.sql](https://github.com/johnnymast/mysql_websocket_chat/blob/master/database.sql) into your database.

## Step 4: Skip step 5 and 6 with Docker!

Docker simplifies running the project by miles and still alows you to change the project files on the fly.  It goes without saying but 
make sure you have docker installed ([get docker](https://www.docker.com/)). You only need to run two commands to get the container up and running.

[more detailed info here](DOCKER.md)

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

***Please note:*** If you are using docker for development on this project make super to configure the WEBSOCKET_SERVER_IP ```(includes/config.php)``` to be 
0.0.0.0. This has to do with bridging a network connection from the virtual host to your own local machine.

Congratulations you can now directly go to step 7, start chatting and have fun running your own chat service!


## Step 5: Fire up the WebSocket server

Change direction into the chat directory and fire up the server.

```bash
$ cd chat
$ php ./server.php
Server running at 0.0.0.0:8090
```

When you see no output and the command seems to hang that's when you know its running.


## Step 6: Point a web service to the public directory

In the chat directory, you will find index.php. This file will be the client for your chat application. Make sure you set any web service its document root to the <code>public/</code> folder. Alternatively, if you don't have access to a webserver you can also try using PHP's
build-in webserver.

```bash
$ cd public
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

<emn>This will start an webserver on port 8080</em>  

## Step 7: Chat away!

Now open up 2 chat tabs and point them to localhost (or maybe a virtual host you configured) and chat away with your self.


## Functionality

### Private chats

If you want to test private chats you can single click any user in the user list on the right of the screen. Then type your message
in the message bar, this will send a private message only to that user.
